# WPFLiveNetworkInterfaceDataValidator

https://kvblake.wordpress.com/


Displays all network interfaces on your computer in a WPF Datagrid.
Displays Bytes Received and Bytes sent for each network interface in real time. (every 500ms)

This application is multi-threaded so it remains responsive.

Can stop the live data feed.

Can optionally set maximum threshold values for selected network interface(s).
Setting max threshold values just displays a red border around the cells in the WPF Datagrid when the value becomes greater than
the maximum threshold values.

Will be adding more information in future versions such as Time Online and Rates.
